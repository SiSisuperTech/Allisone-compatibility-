# Visiquick

Tags: In progress

## Requirements:

- Know the location of the Visiquick installation on the computer.
- Determine if the Visiquick database uses the default configuration or requires a password. (Most dentists use the **default database configuration Firebird**)

## In Allisone+ youâ€™ll need to set :

1. The Visiquick installation folder. (default installation folder is **C:\Visiquick**)
2. The fbclient.dll available on the computer if the database is installed on the current computer (at this path: C:\Program Files\Firebird\Firebird_3_0_vq\fbclient.dll).
You can use this file otherwise, you can download it on the Visiquick installation folder
    
    [allisone-fbclient.dll](allisone-fbclient.dll)
    
3. The password to the database. you can try the default one (**Zg0Thz1N**) but if this password doesnâ€™t work youâ€™ll need to ask the dentist or IT department for it.
