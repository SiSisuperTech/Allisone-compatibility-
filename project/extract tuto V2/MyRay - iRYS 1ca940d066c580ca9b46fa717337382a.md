    If this page is displayed, the prat needs to contact his pano installer so that he can set the pano correctly.

You’ll just need to add the path to the folder you just create in Allisone+ and it’s good to go

## Bridge mode

You’ll have to add the path to the bridge executable of iRYS in Allisone+
