# Deployment Status Guide

Your app is now being deployed to GitHub Pages. Here's how to check the deployment status and ensure everything is working correctly.

## Checking Deployment Status

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/SiSisuperTech/Allisone-compatibility-
2. Click on the "Actions" tab at the top
3. You should see the "Deploy App" workflow running (or completed)
4. Click on the workflow run to see detailed logs
5. Once completed successfully, your app will be available at: 
   https://SiSisuperTech.github.io/Allisone-compatibility-/

## Enabling GitHub Pages

If this is your first deployment, you may need to enable GitHub Pages:

1. Go to your repository "Settings"
2. In the sidebar, click "Pages"
3. Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

## Verifying Data Sharing

To verify that data sharing is working correctly:

1. Make a change to compatibility data in your local app
2. The app should create a GitHub issue in your repository
3. Check the "Issues" tab to see if the issue was created
4. The GitHub Actions workflow should process this issue and update the data files
5. After a few minutes, all other users should see the updated data

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Deployment Failed

If the deployment workflow fails:

1. Check the error message in the GitHub Actions logs
2. Common issues include:
   - Missing dependencies
   - Build errors
   - Path configuration issues in vite.config.ts

### Data Updates Not Processing

If data updates aren't processing:

1. Make sure the GitHub issue is being created with the "data-update" label
2. Check if the process-data-updates.yml workflow is running
3. Look for error messages in the workflow logs
4. Verify that the directory paths in the workflow match your repository structure

### App Not Loading After Deployment

If the app deploys but doesn't load correctly:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Make sure the base URL in vite.config.ts matches your repository name
3. Verify that all assets are being loaded from the correct paths

## Next Steps

1. Test the app by accessing the deployed URL
2. Make a data change to test the update workflow
3. Share the URL with other users

For any questions or issues, feel free to check the documentation or GitHub Actions logs for more information.
